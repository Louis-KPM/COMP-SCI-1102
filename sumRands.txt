The sumRands script could produce a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value
of 50.

Given that it is equivalent to rolling 5 d10s and summing the rolls, the
results will be in a distribution that approaches a normal curve. So those
minimum and maximum values will occur rarely.

The average will be ~27-28.
